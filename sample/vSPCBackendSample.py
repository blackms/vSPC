vSPCBackendSample.py - Sample backend for vSPC.py

Example file to show a sample backend implementation, inheriting from
vSPCBackendMemory. This demonstrates how to modify the hooks in your
own backend implementation. Hooks can block arbitrarily, as they run
on a separate worker thread, in order of VM modification. If you want
to see another reasonable example, look at the code for
vSPCBackendFile, which also overrides vSPCBackendMemory.

Run with something like:
  PYTHONPATH=/path/to/sample vSPC.py -s --backend Sample
